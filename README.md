# Going-On-Vacation
A tour operator offers package holidays in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal and France. The program you are given defines an array with those options and takes N number as input. Write a program to output the package option with N index. If the number is out of range, program should output "Wrong number". Regardless of the option results, the program should output "Goodbye" at the end.
